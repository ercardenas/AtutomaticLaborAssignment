# Automatic Labor Assignment
This is a personal project to automate the labor assignment for Halstead Co-op.

Halstead is a housing co-op in which college students control the organization. Since the house is run by the own the students, there is something called labor. Labor is the share of the work necessary to operate the house, such as cooking, cleaning,  doing dishes, etc. This typically requires 4 hours per week by each person at the house. 

Labor schedules are manually assigned according to the student's aviability, so my goal is to automate this process. Members of the house will fill out a short monkey survey about their unavailibity. Here is the link of the survey:

After getting all the members schedule, I run my python script to automatic assign labor according to their preferences.
